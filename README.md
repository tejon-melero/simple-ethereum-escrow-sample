#Escrow contract for payments between buyers  and sellers: <br>
An escrow is a service for a buyer to be confident that he does not have to release the funds to the seller unless he is happy with the service provided

Usually a third party is employed to control the funds and acts as a trusted party that charges fees for their service. 

An ethereum smart contract can be the trusted party for this kind of transaction because smart contracts by design operate in a trust-les smanner.
